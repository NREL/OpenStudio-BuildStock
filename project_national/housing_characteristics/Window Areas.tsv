# Created by: sources\rbsa_II\tsv_maker.py
# Source: Constructed using 2016-17 Residential Building Stock Assessment (RBSA) II microdata.
# Assumption: The window to wall ratios (WWR) are exponential weibull distributed.
# Assumption: Multi-Family with 2-4 Units distributions are independent of Geometry Stories
# Assumption: Multi-Family with 5+ Units distributions are grouped by 1-3 stories, 4-9 stories, and 10+ stories
# Assumption: High-rise Multi-family buildings (10+ stories) have a 30% window to wall ratio (WWR)
# Assumption: SFD, SFA, and Mobile Homes are represented by the SFD window area distribution
