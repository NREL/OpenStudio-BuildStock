- Add a multifamily project which includes housing characteristic distributions for single-family detached, single-family attached, and multifamily buildings ([#151](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/151))
- Ability to add central systems (boiler with baseboards, fan coil, PTAC) to multifamily buildings using the openstudio-standards gem ([#151](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/151))
- Ability to simulate large multifamily buildings using "collapsed" buildings with multipliers on building units ([#206](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/206))
- Automatically generate dependency graphs and a dependency wheel for each project ([#211](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/211))
- Add measures for calculating construction properties, modeling power outages and calculating resilience metrics, and calculating utility bills ([#151](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/151))
- Add measure for modeling shared multiifamily facades using adiabatic constructions ([#151](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/151))

- Create example workflow osw files for single-family detached, single-family attached, and multifamily buildings using TMY weather ([#151](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/151))

Fixes
- Reporting measures read from ReportMeterData table to get disaggregated fan and pump energy ([#151](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/151))
- Break out central system heating, cooling, and pump energy in reporting measures ([#151](https://github.com/NREL/resstock/pull/151))
